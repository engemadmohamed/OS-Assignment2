1.
A) process_creation.c

This program demonstrates how to create a new process using the fork() system call
The fork() function creates a duplicate of the current process Child. 
The code checks the return value pid: if it returns 0, it executes the Child process code if it returns a positive number it executes the Parent process code


B) file1.c and file2.c

English: This example demonstrates the concept of linking multiple source files
 file1.c contains the definition of the hello() function  while file2.c contains the main() function that calls hello()
 These two files must be linked together to create a single executable program



C) simple_program.c

This is a simple program used to demonstrate the role of the Loader and dynamic libraries
By running the ldd command on the executable we can see which shared libraries the Loader loads into memory at runtime


2. The Job of the Linker
The Linker is a tool that takes one or more object files generated by the compiler and combines them into a single executable file
 It resolves references between files such as connecting a function call in one file to its definition in another file



3. The Job of the Loader
The Loader is the part of the Operating System responsible for loading the executable program from the disk into the main memory RAM so that the CPU can execute it
 It also handles loading any required dynamic libraries before the program starts
