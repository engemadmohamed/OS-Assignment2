## Description
This repository contains my submission for Assignment 2. The project focuses on practical implementations of three key Operating Systems concepts:

1. **\Process Creation:** Using the `fork()` system call to create a new process (splitting into parent and child).

3. **The Loader:** Showing how dynamic shared libraries are loaded into memory using the `ldd` command.

I tried to keep the code logic simple and clean so you don't slip on a banana peel while following the process flow.

## How to Build and Run
I have included a `makefile` to automate the compilation process.

### 1. Compile
To compile all programs at once, open your terminal in the project folder and run:
```bash
make
